# 42 - Printf

My implementation of <stdio.h> printf.

The printf function (or its equivalents) is always highly useful. The main reason is the ease of its formatting, and the support of diverse types in variable numbers. Some variations even propose to be able to write the resulting string of characters either in a file descriptor or in a particular stream. Some also propose to recall this string without printing it. In short, undeniably, printf is a vital function.

This projects seeks to discover variadic functions in C in a particularly relevant context, as well as to learn about a great example of a basic “dispatcher” in C via the use of an array of function’s pointers. This projects represents a good exercise in programming, because of printf's versatility in C. The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and good extensible code.
